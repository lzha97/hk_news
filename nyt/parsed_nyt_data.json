This new documentary revisits the seven weeks that led up to the killings and maps out how a peaceful, student-led movement ended in unthinkable carnage. The director Ian MacMillan weaves archival footage with testimony from protesters, witnesses and Communist Party insiders who watched the tragedy unfold. \n",

It can be easy to underestimate the struggles of a place so seemingly flawless. But Santa Barbara has had a tough few years.

Yet if it weren\u2019t for the charred chaparral faintly visible on the surrounding hillsides, the average visitor might never know. This is, after all, a place that\u2019s good at reinventing itself. That spirit is on display at the new Hotel Californian, which sits on the site of a grand beach resort that was destroyed \u2014 just weeks after opening \u2014 by the 1925 earthquake that defined modern Santa Barbara\u2019s architecture and character. Smack in the center of Southern California\u2019s spectacular coastline, the county is surprisingly rural. In its multigenerational ranches and farms, its remarkably undeveloped public beaches, and the expansive Los Padres National Forest, Santa Barbara County offers glimpses of California before it got crowded.\n",

Born in 1951, Jang is Chinese-American, and grew up in Marysville, Calif., which is right outside Sacramento. From the start, he showed a natural affinity with the camera \u2014 his earliest pictures are of the Jang family in intimate moments: gathering at Christmas, watering the garden, doing the laundry. The pictures are playful, full of curiosity and laughter. Later, while attending school at Cal Arts, Jang found ways to rub shoulders with movie stars and politicians and other celebrities at the Beverly Hilton Hotel \u2014 he photographed figures such as Ronald Reagan, Jack Lemmon and David Bowie. Other moments, with crowds or bellhops, show how people and faces were fascinating for Jang. Afterward, he moved north to San Francisco, where he began to capture scenes on the street or out at night. It was the \u201970s, and there\u2019s something electric about seeing San Francisco through Jang\u2019s eyes. I grew up in the Bay Area a decade and a half later, not too far from where Jang wandered around (and still does) \u2014 and though his pictures feel very familiar to me, that\u2019s not why I find them so compelling. There\u2019s something to admire in how technically precise Jang is in working in black and white \u2014 he seems to understand intuitively the depth of a picture before he even takes it, and I admire him more for how incredibly witty he can be, catching visual puns or simply revealing the humor of a particular moment: the college kid who has passed out sucking his thumb; the expression on the Sex Pistols\u2019 Johnny Rotten\u2019s face caught by surprise while lying low at Japantown\u2019s Miyako Hotel. \u201cMichael Jang\u2019s California\u201d is on view from Sept. 27, 2019 to Jan. 18, 2020 at McEvoy Foundation for the Arts in San Francisco.

        "lead_paragraphs": "Four years ago, the London-based marketing executive Cassie Holland set out to make pure wool sweaters for herself and her close friends. As a rock music fan, she strove to channel the D.I.Y. ethos laid out in the self-taught musician Viv Albertine\u2019s 2014 feminist punk memoir \u201cClothes, Clothes, Clothes. Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys.\u201d The resulting pieces \u2014 a collection of youthful, boldly hued knits made from merino and lamb\u2019s wool and adorned with the knitted names of beloved bands such as Devo and Joy Division \u2014 quickly found a following on Instagram. Last year, Holland won the British Fashion Council\u2019s Fashion Potential Award, and while the brand\u2019s international profile is growing, she is committed to working with British and family-run businesses, both in the Pennine mountains of Yorkshire, where her yarn is milled, and in Hawick, Scotland, where her sweaters are crafted by hand. For recent collections, she has drawn inspiration from sources including Virginia Woolf\u2019s 1925 novel \u201cMrs. Dalloway\u201d (which prompted woven slogans like \u201cmelancholy\u201d and \u201ctrue self\u201d) and the color combinations found on old covers of The Paris Review. This season, a holiday in Greece was her starting point: While in Athens this past summer, she recalls, \u201cWe stayed with friends in the historically anarchic suburb of Exarcheia.\u201d The collection\u2019s standout piece, the Carrington cardigan, plays with the same fusion of tradition and rebellion. The V-neck style comes in British postbox red, navy and black and fastens with oversize mythology-themed buttons: the heads of Aphrodite, Athena, Zeus and Medusa, 3-D-printed in resin.\n",
